Hello, world! I’m Marnie, a 24-year-old diving headfirst into the world of **data analysis** with R Studio and Power BI. This project is part of my journey, and I’m super excited to share what I’ve learned. 🚀

## What’s Inside? 📂

This project tackles a dataset filled with movie goodness—ratings, audience scores, genres, profitability, and more! Using **R Studio** and **Power BI**, I cleaned, analysed, and visualised all the juicy details. 🎬🍿

### Key Goals:
- Explore and clean the data ✨
- Create visually stunning insights 📈
- Answer burning questions like:
  - Which genre rocks Rotten Tomatoes? 🍅
  - Which movie studios rake in the most dough? 💰
  - How many films were made each year? 🎥

## The Workflow 🛠️

### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
I kicked things off with **R Studio**:
- **Loaded the data** (because what’s an analysis without data?).
- Inspected and prepped it, goodbye, missing values! 👋
- **Plotted scatterplots and bar charts** to uncover trends.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
Nobody likes messy data! 🧹
- I checked for nulls, missing rows, and inconsistencies.
- Streamlined it into a neat, analyzable format.

### Step 3: Visualisation with Power BI
Time to get colorful and creative! 🎨
- Imported clean data into **Power BI**.
- Created sleek dashboards using brand colors (blue, green, brown). 🟦🟩🟫

## Cool Findings 🧠

Here’s the lowdown on my analysis:

### 🍿 Top Genres by Rotten Tomatoes
- **Animation** scored highest with an 80.33% rating.
- **Action** didn’t fare so well, clocking in at just 11%.

### 🎥 Trends in Film Production
- Movie production peaked in **2008** and **2010**. What happened in 2009? 🤔

### 🏆 Most Loved Movies by Audiences
- **WALL-E** and **A Dangerous Method** stole hearts with 89% scores. ❤️

### 💸 Studio Profitability
- Independent studios are the MVPs here, top of the profitability charts! Disney and Warner Bros. followed.

### 🌍 Worldwide Gross by Genre
- Comedy is king! With 52.77% of the gross, it’s miles ahead of the rest. 😂

## Reflection 🌟

Looking back on this project, I’ve realized how much I’ve grown as a budding data analyst.

-**Biggest Challenge:** Learning to clean messy data was both frustrating and rewarding—it taught me patience and attention to detail.
-**Biggest Win:** Seeing my Power BI dashboard come to life was a "wow" moment. It made all the effort worthwhile. 🎉
-**What’s Next?** I want to dive deeper into machine learning and predictive analysis to uncover even cooler insights. 🤖

This journey has been a mix of trial, error, and lots of fun, and I can’t wait to see where it leads next! 🚀
